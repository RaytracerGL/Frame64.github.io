<h1>Project Ray Buffer 64</h1>
<p>By: Binary64</p>

<p>Ray Buffer 64 is a basic replacment frame buffer for the nintendo 64, 
  it was made to fix a plethora of graphical bugs and make games run fater. 
  Currently it is still in development and is just a basic replacment 
  that can run of a modified memory pak (32kb) with the help of a 
  cartrige patch to redirect all frame buffer calls to the memory pak.
  The aim is to one day bring raytracers to the N64</p>

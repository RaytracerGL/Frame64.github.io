<h1>Project Ray Buffer iQue</h1>
<p>By: Binary64</p>

<p>Ray Buffer iQue is a basic replacment frame buffer for the nintendo iQue/N64 , 
  it was made to fix a plethora of graphical bugs and make games run fater. 
  Currently it is still in development and is just a basic replacment 
  that can run of a iQue card (64mb) with the help of a 
  ROM patch to redirect all frame buffer calls to the memory adress in the iQue card.
  The aim is to one day bring raytracers and better graphics to the iQue</p>
